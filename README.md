## Project Overview

This project is a fully developed and comprehensive, data-driven web service app. It was built using **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **MySQL**, focusing on a real-world lawsuit investigation. 

## Infrastructure 

A robust data infrastructure was established with a self-hosted MySQL database and two AWS EC2 instances - one hosting the application and master database, and the other serving as a replica for increased data reliability and performance.

## Task Automation

Designed and executed a scheduled task using CRON jobs, which performs daily data scraping using Pythonâ€™s Beautiful Soup and facilitates automated backup of the database via mysqldump exports and imports, enhancing data safety and integrity.

## Domain and Security

Configured AWS Route 53 for domain purchase and forwarding, and set up HTTPS for secure communication. 

## Database Integration

Integrated the database with the web application to display real-time data to users, applying best practices for data security by using a MySQL user with limited privileges. 

## Version Control

Utilized Git for effective version control throughout the project.
