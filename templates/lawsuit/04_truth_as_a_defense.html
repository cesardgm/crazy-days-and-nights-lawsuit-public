    <h3>IV. Truth as a Defense</h3>
    <p>
        Enty Lawyer's potential defense could revolve around several aspects. Enty Lawyer could argue that his blog is a
        platform for speculative celebrity gossip rather than a source of provable facts. Furthermore, he may contend
        that many of Jenkins' claims are null due to the one-year statute of limitations. He may also assert that
        Jenkins, being a public figure, must demonstrate that he acted with "actual malice," which she may struggle to
        prove. Enty Lawyer's attorney has also submitted a motion to strike the lawsuit under California's anti-SLAPP
        statute. This statute aims to safeguard defendants from meritless suits that intend to suppress speech on topics
        of public interest. If successful, this motion could dismiss the case early by demonstrating that the suit is
        without merit and aims to stifle his free speech.

        The legal requirements for asserting truth as a defense in a defamation lawsuit can vary by jurisdiction, but
        generally, the following elements must be met. Firstly, the statement must be substantially true, meaning the
        gist or the primary point of the statement is true, even if some minor details are inaccurate. Secondly, the
        statement must be a fact, not an opinion, because only factual statements can be proven true or false. Thirdly,
        the defendant carries the burden of proving the statement's truth and must provide evidence to support this.
        Fourthly, the truth of the statement must be relevant to the matter at hand. For example, a true statement with
        no impact on the plaintiff's reputation or character may not serve as a valid defense. Lastly, even if the
        statement is true, it may not be a valid defense if made with malice - this signifies that the statement was
        made with the intent to harm the plaintiff or with reckless disregard for the truth.
