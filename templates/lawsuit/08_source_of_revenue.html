    <h3>VIII. Source of Revenue</h3>
    <p>
        In the defamation lawsuit filed by Sanela Jenkins, the defendant, Enty Lawyer, allegedly generates income from
        various online activities, including advertising and Patreon contributions. Jenkins claims that Enty Lawyer
        intentionally made defamatory statements with the aim of harming her economically while simultaneously boosting
        his own financial gains.
        <br><br>
        According to the lawsuit, Enty Lawyer's blog, which reportedly receives millions of views weekly, could be a
        significant source of revenue due to the numerous ads displayed along with his controversial "blind items" and
        "reveals." If these allegations are proven, they could potentially influence the amount of punitive damages
        awarded in this case.
        <br><br>
        Punitive damages, unlike compensatory damages, are designed to punish the defendant and deter similar conduct in
        the future. If it is proven that Enty Lawyer knowingly published defamatory statements with the expectation of
        financial gain, this could be seen as particularly egregious behavior warranting punitive damages. Courts may
        consider the defendant's income and the profitability of the defamatory conduct when determining the amount of
        punitive damages. Thus, the alleged revenue from Enty Lawyer's online activities could be highly relevant in
        assessing punitive damages. However, it should be stressed that these are allegations that have yet to be proven
        in court.
